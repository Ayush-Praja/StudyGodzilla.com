Paragraph On Dussehra – 100 Words for Classes 1, 2, 3 Kids


Dussehra is a famous festival celebrated in our country India. It marks the day on which Lord Rama defeated the demon king Ravan. The celebration is to remember that the good and holy always wins over evil. The members of the families dress up and come together to spend time with each other on Dussehra by eating good food and watching fireworks. Many people go out and spend time at the prominent fairs of Dussehra. In these fairs, some local theatre groups stage the play of Ramleela, which is based on Ramayana’s famous Hindu mythological legend. The burning of the big figures representing Ravan, Meghnad, and Kumbhkaran marks the end of this celebration.
